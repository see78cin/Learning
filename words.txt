Writing? programs! or programming is a very creative
and rewarding activity:1.  You can write programs for
many reasons ranging from making your living to solving
a difficult data analysis problem to having fun to helping
someone else solve a problem.  This book assumes that
everyone needs to know how to program and that once
you know how to program, you will figure out what you want
to do with your newfound skills?

We are surrounded in our daily lives with computers ranging
from laptops to cell phones.  We can think of these computers
as our personal assistants who can take care of many things
on our behalf.  The hardware in our current-day computers
is essentially built to continuously ask us the question
What would you like me to do next?

Our computers are fast and have vasts amounts of memory and 
could be very helpful to us if we only knew the language to 
speak to explain to the computer what we would like it to 
do next. If we knew this language we could tell the 
computer to do tasks on our behalf that were reptitive.
Interestingly, the kinds of things computers can do best
are often the kinds of things that we humans find boring
and mind-numbing.

Murray Brewster is senior defence writer for CBC News, based in Ottawa. He has covered the Canadian military and foreign policy from Parliament Hill for over a decade. Among other assignments, he spent a total of 15 months on the ground covering the Afghan war for The Canadian Press. Prior to that, he covered defence issues and politics for CP in Nova Scotia for 11 years and was bureau chief for Standard Broadcast News in Ottawa.
Ottawa has yet to fully explain how the money will be spent, other than to say approximately $15 billion will go to infrastructure upgrades?

Speaking at 5 Wing Goose Bay in Newfoundland and Labrador on Wednesday, Anand said the base is one of four that will see improvement!

She said the airfield "will receive significant upgrades which will enable its continued ability to support NORAD operations and to ensure the defence of North America."

"As we look around the world today," she continued, "we recognize that our geography and our existing continental defences no longer provide the same protection that they once did."
